# Magic Match Memory Game #
A fun and challenging memory game built with React. The objective of the game is to match all cards in pairs within 45 seconds. The game keeps track of the number of turns you take and displays it on the screen.

## How to Play ##
Click on a card to reveal its hidden image.
Click on another card to reveal its hidden image.
If the two images match, the cards will remain face up and you can move on to the next pair.
If the two images do not match, both cards will flip back over and you can try again.
Repeat until all cards are matched or the timer runs out.
